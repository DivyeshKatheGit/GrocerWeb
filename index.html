                            <p>Biggest problem other online grocery players are facing is a huge amount of money being spent for new customer acquisition in the form of advertisements & other marketing tactics, the other big problem is customer retention and thus end up providing huge discounts which turn up into huge losses. this model will help us acquire & retain customers without having to spend much on marketing as the regular customer will select their preferred store any day & will be their first choice, as well as the retail stores will publicize the app themselves by looking at their increased sales & margins.</p>

                            <p>Another big advantage for regular consumers apart from speedy delivery is Credit Facility offered by their nearby Kirana. Even modern store is not able to provide credits as they have to contend with high costs in the form of store inventory, staff, and administration. As coming online, all their regular customers will have an option to place the order on credit facility if enabled by Kirana owner. Automization of this process will save lots of time of consumers as well as Kirana stores eliminating hectic record-keeping into books and avoiding mismatch at the time of payment.</p>

                        <div class="inner">
                            <p>This option will save precious time of consumers as their favorite or fixed essential products will always be there without them having to select or search again or having the burden to prepare a monthly list of what they need. Consumers will be able to subscribe to their fixed essentials with the preferred date of delivery every month. By this, they will be getting lots of offers & deals from the stores as well as brands. This option will be a win-win situation for both as even retail stores will be assured as subscribed customers mean fixed sales & margins every month. Credit Facilities discussed above will also turn customers for opting fixed Monthly Subscription.</p>

                        <div class="inner">
                            <p>Another biggest problem for other online grocers working on any model is delivery & logistics which costs them very high. On the other hand, Kirana shops / small modern trade shops usually provide free delivery in less than an hour in their nearby areas. Like food, groceries are also something consumers expect soon at their doorstep, by purchasing from their nearby & trusted stores they will not have to worry about high delivery charges that too with the additional benefit of superfast delivery within few minutes.</p>

                            <p>Kirana Shops usually gets 5 – 10 orders minimum over call or WhatsApp by their regular customers, this again is a hectic process for Kirana to write down and deliver accordingly. This does not help users on the other hand as they always have to send such lists by remembering what they need at the moment. Creating Order directly into the system will help Kirana’s to track their inventory as well as sales perfectly, also this will send online payment links with other app details to customers on their mobile numbers providing them the option to pay online eliminating the issues of keeping exact cash at the moment. Receiving payment online will help Kirana stores in numerous ways as well as consumers will get huge benefits for paying online & repeatedly this process will encourage consumers to download our app for next purchase rather than calls or other mediums.</p>

                            <p>Almost all the online grocers are struggling as making money on food and groceries where the margins are wafer-thin is very challenging. Small Kiranas work on low margins and for that giving commissions on every order is very hard for them, even in the inventory model huge expenses occurred in storage, operations & logistics steals away all the options of earning or even reaching profitability. “No Commission”  SaaS- model will encourage them to come online and promote themselves as no commission have to be paid on any sales they do.</p>

                            By modernizing the Kirana shops and ensuring that business becomes better for them on the suplyside by the use of technology, we will be ensuring that both customers and business owners get thebenefit.</p>
